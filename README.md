# Local Restaurants

URL: [[My Local Restaurants](https://localrestvanjs.netlify.app/)]

This application shows local restaurants in a 1KM radius of your current location based on the keywords you specify. It is written primarily in Vanilla Javascript and utilizes the [[Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) for the map and place search. 

It will return any restaurants it finds in an easy to view list (including name, address and whether it is open right now) and will also populate the map with interactive markers.

Included is a custom webpack configuration for easy deployment.
